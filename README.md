# SC 2026 Tutorial:  AI Agents for Scientific Computing 

The contents of this repo showcase the planned content for a 3 hour tutorial at SC26. This tutorial consists of 5 parts:

1. Introduction to AI Agents
2. LAB: Introduction to TACC compute resources
3. LAB: Introduction to building simple agents
4. LAB: Building agents for data analysis
5. LAB: Building agents for use in HPC environments

>[!NOTE]
> For Part (3) and Part (4): Dependencies are specified in the requirements.txt in this repo
> For Part (5): We will have an *additional* dependency called TACC_exAI (an experimental agent framework code developed at TACC which will be provided at a later date due to on going research)


## Environment setup instructions

### On TACC Resources

Detailed instructions for accessing TACC's compute resources and setting up your environment for the Labs 3-5 is included in the slide deck for Part (2).  These instructions will be updated closer to the actual event.  

### On your local machine

While this training will be conducted on TACC infrastructure, in the event of network issues at the venue, we are providing some general instructions
on setting up a workable environment on your local machines.

>[!CAUTION]
> We are unable to provide specific instructions/support for individual machines given that this would be highly dependent on your specific platform
> (i.e Hardware, Operating System and other tool chains). Please try and adapt the generic instructions provided to your specific machine

Other software dependencies:
>[!NOTE]
>  Please note that these are prerequisites and we expect them to be setup before the tutorial.
> Given the time constraints of the tutorial, we will be unable to pause instruction to assist to provide additional support for installations issues individually
